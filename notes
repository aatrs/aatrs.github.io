        First written: 2023-01-05

We consider a probability space "(Omega, F, P)".
  * Let F be the power set of Omega: 2^Omega
  * Abusing notation: f in F when f is a F-measurable function.



::: Rolling one dice

Let "Omega = { d_1, d_2, ..., d_6 }", with the uniform probability P.

Let F_i : a filtration(information structure) such that
  * F_0 represents information structure before rolling a dice,
  * F_1 represents information structure after rolling a dice.

Note that
  * The game "g_i := 1_{d_i}" is not in F_0,
  * That means the set "{x : g_i(x) = 1}" is not in F_0,
  * So we can derive that it should be "F_0 = {emptySet, Omega}".

Note also that
  * The game "g(d_i) := i" is in F_1.
  * It should be that "F_1 = F".



::: Rolling one dice

We set
        
    Omega = { ( d_i, e_j ) : i, j from 1 to 6 },
    P( { (d_i, f_j) } ) = 1/36.

Let F_i : a filtration(information structure) s.t.
  * F_0 represents information structure before rolling a dice,
  * F_1 represents information structure after rolling the 1st dice,
  * F_1 represents information structure after rolling the 2nd dice.

Any non‑constant game can't be in F_0. So, "F_0 = {emptySet, Omega}".
Trivially, F_2 = F.

Note that
  * The game "g_0( d_i, e_j ) := i" is not in F_0, but in F_1.
  * Any game that the value is independent of the 2nd dice is in F_1,
    but not in F_2 otherwise.
  * Therefore, we have
        
    F_1 := { I_1, I_2, ..., I_6 },
    I_i := { (d_i, e_j) : j from 1 to 6 }.










:: [Mathmatics] Generating normal random number
        First written: 2023-01-05
    
The following practical methods are well‑known:
  * Box–Muller transform   [ref:Box_Muller_1958]
  * Marsaglia polar method [ref:Marsaglia_1964]
  * Ziggurat algorithm



::: Box–Muller transform

For independent uniform random variables U_1, U_2 on [0,1], let
        
    V_1 := sqrt[ -2 ln(U_1) ] cos(2 pi U_2),
    V_2 := sqrt[ -2 ln(U_1) ] sin(2 pi U_2).

Then V_1 and V_2 are independent and are standard normal.

Indeed, the joint distributions satisfy the decomposition
        
    f_V = f_U / |J|
        =   1 / |J|
        = N_{V_1} N_{V_2}
        = f_{V_1} f_{V_2}.

Where, N is the PDF of the standard normal distribution.
The jacobian |J|, with entry "|J|_{ij} = Diff_{U_j} V_i", is computed as
        
    |J| = - 2 pi / U_1
        = - 2 pi exp( [ (V_1)^2 + (V_2)^2 ] / 2 ).



::: Marsaglia polar method

Let "S = (U_1)^2 + (U_2)^2", with U_i as the above.
Under the condition "0 < S < 1", The random variables
        
    V_1 := U_1 sqrt[ -2 ln(S) / S ],
    V_2 := U_2 sqrt[ -2 ln(S) / S ],

are independent and standard normal.










:: Perturbation theory
        First written: 2023-01-06

We consider the problem for u_ep with some (usually small) constant ep:
        
    [The main problem]
    L_ep u_ep = v,

where ep stands for epsilon, L^\ep is an operator.
The Perturbation theory is for solving u_ep, based on the case ep = 0,
which is tractable.

We refer some popular texts on the perturbation theory:
  * [ref:bender_orszag_1999]
  * [ref:johnson_2004]



::: Introduction

We first set "L_ep = L_0 + ep I",
  * where L_0 and I are linear operators independent of ep.
  * Also, "L_ep = L_0" when we put ep = 0.

The idea of the theory is to express u as the power series for ep, so
        
    u_ep = u_0 + ep u_1 + ep^2 u_2 + ...,
    u_i = O(ep^0) = O(1).

The superscript index notation is prefered in some texts,
like u^i instead of u_i, and in that case,
the notation does not mean the power(square, cube...) notation.

Putting the series to the main problem,
and arranging the terms, like arranging a polynomial for ep, we have
        
    L_0 (u_0) = v,
    ep^{i+1} ( L^0 (u_{i+1}) + I (u_i) ) = 0,  i>0.

where we assume
        
    |L_0 (u_i)| + |I (u_i)| = O(1).

  * If the assumption holds, then, usually,
    we are in the so-called "regular perturbation" problem.
  * Suppose this does not hold; for example, "I (u_i) = O(1/ep)".
    The case is called the "singular perturbation" problem; considered later.

Other arrangements may be considered, however, this argument is reasonable.
When ep is very small, this arrangement gives scale-consistant statement.
Also, this helps the analysis with general value of ep.

Reversely, if u_i satisfies the above equations,
then, 'formally', u_ep, as the series, solves the main problem.

Next, we are interested in the actual asymptotics of the series.
For example, we consider the residual error "E_2" as
        
    E_2 = u_ep - u_0 - ep u_1.

We expect that "E_2 = O(ep^2)" in some sense. Notice that
        
    L_ep (E_2) = ep^2 I (u_2).

In general, some analysis may be required to justify the asymptotics.
Since the problem is lienar, you may want so prove the the solution "w" of
        
    L_ep (w) = f,  f = O(1)

is of O(1).

Similarly, we can consider "E_i = O(ep^i)$,
that is, the series converges as i goes to infinity, when ep < 1.



::: Singular perturbation

We go back to the arrangements
        
    L_0 (u_0) = v,
    ep^{i+1} ( L^0 (u_{i+1}) + I (u_i) ) = 0,  i>0.

Suppose that "I (u_i) = O(1/ep)", instead of O(1).
The formulation is not valid anymore, so we should consider other approaches.

The problems that are classified as the "singular perturbation" problem,
have various aspacts, and many of the problems have the following properties:
  * The operator I, rather than L_0, determines the "type" of the problem.
    For example,
        
    L_0 (v) = Diff   v,
    I   (v) = Diff^2 v.

    Then the main problem is the second-order differential equations.
    That is, the perturbation "changes" the problem.

  * Some operator in the problem changes the scale of the applied.
    For example, even though u_ep = O(1), It can be that "I (u_ep) = O(1/ep)".
  
  * Laurent of sense series may be considered to express the solution:
        
    u_ep = ... + ep^{-1} u_{-1} + u_0 + ep u_1 + ...

  * The solution of the perturbed problem can be completely different from 
    the solution of the unperturbed problem.

The "singular perturbation theory" deals with
understanding and techniques of solving the singularly perturbed problems.
Usually, this theory consider the many specific problems,
rather than general definitions or theorems like other mathmatical theories.



::: Example : regularly perturbed differential equation
        
    ep y(x) + y'(x) = e^x, y(0) = 1.

To be written...



:::: Example : regularly perturbed quadratic equation
        
    x^2 + ep x - 1 = 0.

To be written...



:::: Example : singularly perturbed differential equation
                
    y(x) + ep y'(x) = e^x, y(0) = 0.

To be written...



:::: Example : singularly perturbed quadratic equation
        
    ep x^2 + x - 1 = 0.

In this case, we can set
        
    L_0 (x) = x - 1,
    I (x) = x^2.

The unpertubed solution is "x_0 = 1".
From this, we derive "x_ep = x_0 + ep x_1 + O(ep^2)", where
        
    ep (1 + ep x_1)^2 + ep x_1 = O(ep^2),
    x_1 = -1.

However, the problem should have two solutions,
and the information for x_0 does not help to find the second solution.
Observe that the operator "ep I" changes type of the problem.

Reminding the graph of "ep I(x) = -L_0(x)",
we can expect the second solution has scale O(1/ep).
We set
        
    z_ep = ep^{-1} z_{-1} + z_0 + O(ep),

So, we have
        
    ep ( ( z_{-1} )/ep + z_0 )^2 + ( z_{-1} )/ep + z_0 - 1 = O(ep),
    ( z_{-1}^2 + z_{-1} )/ep + ( 2 z_{-1} z_0 + z_0 - 1 ) = O(ep).
        
    z_{-1}^2 + z_{-1} = 0,
    2 z_{-1} z_0 + z_0 - 1 = 0.
        
    z_{-1} = -1,
    z_0    =  1,
    z_ep   = -1/ep + 1 + O(ep).

We drop the case "z_{-1} = 0" since this revert the solution to be regular.

Indeed, from the root formula for quadratic equation,
        
    x = [ -1 +- sqrt( 1 + 4 ep )                    ] / (2 ep)
      = [ -1 +- ( 1 + 2 ep - (4 ep)^2/8 + O(ep^3) ) ] / (2 ep)
      = [ -1 +- ( 1 + 2 ep - 2 ep^2               ) ] / (2 ep) + O(ep^2).

So, each of +- gives
        
    x_+ = -1/ep + 1 + O(ep),
    x_- =         1 -   ep  + O(ep^2).

Compare them to x_ep and z_ep.
